Support options are all through the community and managed by the KeyDB team at Snap Inc. Because KeyDB is solely an open source project, there are no paid support services available, however the KeyDB team actively monitors issues and channels regularly. 

## Start by Searching the Docs

KeyDB documentation is always a great place to start! Search keywords or follow the sidebars to navigate. It can also be noted that outside of KeyDB specific features there is a lot of overlap with Redis (outside of KeyDB specific features) so google/stack overflow for Redis are also a great resource.

## General Questions

General questions about KeyDB are best posted in the [Community Forum](https://community.keydb.dev) or on [Slack](/docs/slack). If it is a question you think could be relevant to other users, the forum is a great place for the discussion to be documented and searchable :). For most questions, and discussions the slack channels are a great place to chat. These are monitored regularly.

## Bugs and Issues

If there is a bug or perceived issue with the KeyDB product, please [create an issue on the KeyDB github repo](https://github.com/EQ-Alpha/KeyDB/issues). This way we can track the bug/fix/PR associated. Github issues is the right place for these. For bugs posted in other forums they may be migrated to github issues for tracking.

## Contributor and Super User Meetup

In addition to the KeyDB team, there are a number of "super-users" within the community who help contribute to the project. This includes users who create PRs, manage supporting KeyDB libraries, perform deep dives on issues, or wish to take a more active role within the project itself. 

For these users, we will have an "All Hands Super-User Monthly Call". Here we will review PRs, issues, and discussion items in detail. These meetings will have a specific agenda which will be posted in advance of each meeting. Join the #monthly-super-user-meet channel for the invite link and to request topics for the call. 

We encourage anyone to attend these meetings who is interested, however we will stick to agenda items set in advance to ensure everything gets covered and the right people are on the call ;).


## Documentation Requests & PRs
The [KeyDB Docs Repo](https://github.com/EQ-Alpha/KeyDB-docs) is where our documentation is maintained. If you find an issue in our docs please create an issue here, or edit and make a PR. 

If you have a request for new documentation, or would like to contribute please create an issue or feel free to chat about it on slack.

## New Feature Requests
If you have a request for a new feature or technology integration, we encourage you to bring it up on Slack or create an issue on github with the tag 'enhancement'
